## Importing a child document

This text and code come from a child document which exists outside of this Walkthrough.qmd file. We can use this to join different sections from different people.

Added citations will also be added to main text (but only if this document is in the same folder as parent).

We can also add [interactive shiny elements](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/ojs/shiny.html) if we wanted, but might take a while to figure that out...
