## User Input for Data Filters Tab ðŸ§

### Using `Apply data filters` button
- The filters will only be applied to the tracking data once this button is pressed.
- If the button has not been pressed then the data presented in the tables and plots is that from the tracking data the user read in with the `upload data` button.
- Users should move the sliders to the required values and then press the button to execute the filtering step. All of the plots and tables will update automatically based off a filtered version of the original dataset. 
 

### Changing `Speed Filter (m/s)` slider
- This will filter all speed values in the data set that are greater than the value that you select on the slider. E.g. if it is set to 30m/s all speeds greater than this will be removed.
- If you have followed our guide then the speeds are the point to point speeds, i.e. the straight line distances between subsequent locations divided by the time between ocation readings.  
- The range of this slider is updated to the bounds of the original data read in.

 
### Changing `Net squared displacement filter (km)` slider
- This will remove all the net squared displacement values in the data set that are greater than the value that you select on the slider
- Net squared displacement is the straight line distance between the first fix recorded for an individual and all subsequent fixes.
- The range of this slider is updated to the bounds of the original data read in.

 
### Changing `Select Date Range` Input
- This will retain all data collected on days that are within the date range that you have selected
- The date range displayed when you read in your data is the full date range of the original data read in.


### Changing map with `Select plot options`
- The drop down menu and buttons within this box allow you to alter the map immediately to the left. 
- The user can toggle between viewing all individual in the data set (population selected) and a single individual (individual selected).
