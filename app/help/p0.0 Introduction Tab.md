## How to use this app 📘
This app is designed to let the user explore how input parameters at various stages of data processing influence the output. The choices of these input parameter values can be nuanced and their influence large downstream outputs. 

<br/>

#### 0. Format data for app
- In order for that app to wotk the user must have their data in the right format 
- If following the `Workflow.R` script then read in the script named `XX_diagnostic.csv`

#### 1. Read in data
- Use the `upload data` button in the top left corner to read in a csv file of your data

#### 2. Data filter tab
- This tab applies preliminary filter to your data set. These checks ensures the data set does not contain any erroneous data
- The user can filter out speed and displacement values that are highly improbable based on the users knowledge of the study system
- The user can also remove data for a certain number of days after tag deployment, as animals do not always behave normally during this period

#### 3. Forging trip tab
- Users can classify foraging trips for animals that are central placed foragers
- User can alter the distance from the central place and duration that a movement must exceed in order to be classified as a foraging trip
- The central place can also be defined with a `shapefile` read in by the user

#### 4. Sub-sampling tab
- Users can alter the temporal resolution of their data. 
- Data is generally made more coarse so that sampling intervals are consistent across individuals and tag types. 
- This is important step when comparing distances between fixes as different sampling intervals may capture different tortuosity in real life movement


#### 5. Segmenting tab
- Users can split up their movement tracks into multiple segments
- Tracks are segmented based on a maximum duration between locations that is defined by the users
- This is an important step when using hidden markov models as this required consistent sampling intervals

#### 6. Interactive map tab
- This tab contains an interactive leaflet map of your tracking data
- There are options to colour movement tracks by different variables and display different individuals

## Workflow

If you're testing the app, it likely means that you're already up and running with the `Workflow.R` script, and have merged, filtered and processed some data. The diagram below will hopefully give you an idea of how this Shiny app fits into the rest of the steps in the workflow:
