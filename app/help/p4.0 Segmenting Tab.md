## User Input for Segmenting Tab ðŸ§ 

<br/>

**NOTE** the data will only be segmented after the `Calculate Segments` button is pressed. Segmenting is not carried out automatically the app is launched. 
Segmenting is often carried out before carrying using hidden markov models to classify movement tracks into different behavioural states.

### Apply `Calculate Segments` button
- The data will only be segmented once this button is pressed. 
- Move the sliders to the required values and then press this button and all of the plots and tables will update with the data segmented to the required interval. 


### Changing `Threshold Interval to Segment Track (mins)` slider
- This is the maximum gap there can be between successive locations. If the interval between locations is larger than the threshold then the track is broken up into two different segments at this point. 
- E.g. if locations are collected at 15 min intervals but there are gaps in the data then the user may decide to segment a movement track if there is a gap greater then 60 mins.
