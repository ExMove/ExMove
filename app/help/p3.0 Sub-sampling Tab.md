### Apply `Sub-sample data` button
- The data will only be sub-sampled once this button is pressed. 
- Move the sliders to the required values and then press this button and all of the plots and tables will update with the data sub-sampled to the required interval. 

### Changing `Required Sampling Interval (mins)` slider
- The time interval between subsequent locations will be sub-sampled to the value chosen on this slider.
- This is not able to create data so if the interval chosen is much shorter that the interval the data was collected at then it will result in little to no change in the number of locations. 
- It is recommended that users choose a value that is a multiple of the most common sampling interval in their own data set. For instance, if the data was collected at a 15 minute interval between locations then sub-sampling to 30, 45 or 60 mins would be suitable. 
- One of the main goals to bear in mind with sub-sampling is that you are often trying to make the sampling interval consistent across all individuals. There do not sub-sample to 1 hour if you know there are lots of individual that collected data at 2 hour intervals.
