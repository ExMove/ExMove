# User Input for Foraging Trip Tab ðŸ§ 

<br/>

#### **NOTE**: Press `Calculate Trip Statistics` button to calcualte foraging trips 

<br/>
<br/>

### Apply `Calculate Trip Statistics` button
- Foraging trips will only be calculated using the input values selected once this button is pressed
- If the user wants to re-calculate foraging trips then the button needs to be pressed again
- All of the plots and tables will update with the current foraging trips once the button is pressed 

<br/>

### How to define Colony
- `Colony distance buffer (Trip Start Distance)`: Choose this option to use the distance to central place calculated in the main workflow
- `Shape file of colony`: Use a shapefile `(.shp)` to define the colony extent and the app will subsequently calculate the distance between each location and the nearest point on the colony

<br/>

### Changing `Trip Start Distance (km)`slider
- This is the minimum distance between the central place and a location for that location to be classed as a part of a foraging trip
- Locations closer to the central place than the value selected on this slider will be classified as instances when the individual was at the colony and were not part of a foraging trip

<br/>

### Changing `Minimum Trip Duration (mins)` slider
- This is the minimum duration that a candidate foraging trip has to be for it to be classified as a true foraging trip. 
- Candidate foraging trips are continuous periods when the the individual was further from the central place than the distance selected on the `Minimum Trip Duration (mins)` slider

<br/>

### `Select Colony` drop down
- If you have chosen the `Shape file of colony` option then this drop down displays the different Populations present in your data set
- Pick the option that denotes which population your shape file refers too, this can be all populations
- If you do not have a `population` column in your data set then only the `All` option will appear

<br/>

### `Upload shape file` button
- Use this button to upload the colony shape file
- Users must upload all file attributed the the `.shp` file, i.e. `.dbf`, `.prj`, `.shx`

<br/>

### `Foraging Trip Summary` tables
- There is a tab for the current and previously calculated foraging trips, Which are calculated each time the `Calculate Trip Statistics` button is pressed
- Therefore to compare two different sets of input values simply set the sliders to the first set of choices and press the button and then change the sliders to the second set of choices and press the button. You will then be able to compare how this effects the number, duration and length of foraging trips
